### 1. Overview

### 2.Data Exploration and Preprocessing

- **Data Analysis**: Conducted an exploratory analysis to understand user interactions with articles. This included visualizing the distribution of interactions and identifying patterns in user behavior.
  
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicate articles to ensure data integrity, keeping only unique article entries.
  
- **Key Insights**:
  - Identified the most viewed article and calculated important statistics such as the number of unique users, articles, and interactions.

- **User Anonymization**: Mapped user emails to unique identifiers to maintain privacy, allowing for efficient data processing in later stages.

### 3. Rank-Based Recommendation System

Rank-based filtering recommends articles by ranking them according to their popularity, measured by the number of user interactions. This method suggests the most frequently interacted-with articles, assuming they are of higher interest to users.

### 4. Collaborative Filtering (User-User)
#### 1. `user_user_recs`

**Description:**  
The initial approach to generating article recommendations based on similar users' interactions.

**Key Steps:**
- **Retrieve Read Articles:** Fetches articles that the target user has already read.
- **Identify Similar Users:** Finds users who are similar to the target user based on interaction patterns.
- **Collect Recommendations:** For each similar user, identifies articles they have liked that the target user hasn't seen.
- **Aggregate Recommendations:** Compiles these articles into a list of recommendations until the specified number (m) is reached.

**Limitations:**
- **Arbitrary Selection:** Chooses users and articles without prioritization, which may lead to less relevant recommendations.
- **No Interaction Prioritization:** Does not consider the number of interactions, potentially overlooking highly relevant content.

#### 2. `user_user_recs_part2`

**Description:**  
An enhanced version of the first approach, improving the recommendation process by prioritizing interactions.

**Key Steps:**
- **Retrieve Read Articles:** Same as the first approach.
- **Identify Similar Users:** Uses a sorted list of similar users, prioritizing those with the most total article interactions.
- **Collect Recommendations:** For each prioritized user, identifies articles they have liked that the target user hasn't seen, focusing on those articles with higher interaction counts.
- **Aggregate Recommendations:** Compiles these articles into a final recommendation list.

**Improvements:**
- **Prioritized Selection:** Chooses users and articles based on the total number of interactions, increasing the likelihood of relevant recommendations.
- **Enhanced Relevance:** By focusing on popular articles, this approach improves the overall quality and relevance of recommendations.
