### 1. Overview
This project developed a comprehensive recommendation system utilizing rank-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and matrix factorization to enhance user experience. Key insights were gained through data exploration and preprocessing, addressing challenges like data discrepancies and sparse interactions.
---

### 2.Data Exploration and Preprocessing

- **Data Analysis**: Conducted an exploratory analysis to understand user interactions with articles. This included visualizing the distribution of interactions and identifying patterns in user behavior.
  
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicate articles to ensure data integrity, keeping only unique article entries.
  
- **Key Insights**:
  - Identified the most viewed article and calculated important statistics such as the number of unique users, articles, and interactions.

- **User Anonymization**: Mapped user emails to unique identifiers to maintain privacy, allowing for efficient data processing in later stages.

---
### 3. Rank-Based Recommendation System

Rank-based filtering recommends articles by ranking them according to their popularity, measured by the number of user interactions. This method suggests the most frequently interacted-with articles, assuming they are of higher interest to users.

---

### 4. Collaborative Filtering (User-User)
#### 1. `user_user_recs`

**Description:**  
The initial approach to generating article recommendations based on similar users' interactions.

**Key Steps:**
- **Retrieve Read Articles:** Fetches articles that the target user has already read.
- **Identify Similar Users:** Finds users who are similar to the target user based on interaction patterns.
- **Collect Recommendations:** For each similar user, identifies articles they have liked that the target user hasn't seen.
- **Aggregate Recommendations:** Compiles these articles into a list of recommendations until the specified number (m) is reached.

**Limitations:**
- **Arbitrary Selection:** Chooses users and articles without prioritization, which may lead to less relevant recommendations.
- **No Interaction Prioritization:** Does not consider the number of interactions, potentially overlooking highly relevant content.

---

#### 2. `user_user_recs_part2`

**Description:**  
An enhanced version of the first approach, improving the recommendation process by prioritizing interactions.

**Key Steps:**
- **Retrieve Read Articles:** Same as the first approach.
- **Identify Similar Users:** Uses a sorted list of similar users, prioritizing those with the most total article interactions.
- **Collect Recommendations:** For each prioritized user, identify articles they have liked that the target user hasn't seen, focusing on those articles with higher interaction counts.
- **Aggregate Recommendations:** Compiles these articles into a final recommendation list.

**Improvements:**
- **Prioritized Selection:** Chooses users and articles based on the total number of interactions, increasing the likelihood of relevant recommendations.
- **Enhanced Relevance:** By focusing on popular articles, this approach improves the overall quality and relevance of recommendations.

### 5. Matrix Factorization

**Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):** SVD is performed on the user-item matrix, breaking it down into three components: user factors, singular values, and item factors. This allows for a reduced representation of the data, making it easier to identify patterns and relationships.

**Choosing Latent Features:** Exploring latent features is crucial, as it impacts the model's ability to make accurate predictions. The number of latent features determines the model's complexity and its ability to capture underlying patterns in the data. This exploration allows for effective dimensionality reduction, preserving essential information that enhances both model performance and interpretability.

**Cold Start Problem:** When splitting the dataset into training and testing sets, it's important to recognize the cold start problem, which arises when new users or articles have insufficient interaction data. This limits the model's ability to make accurate recommendations for these entities.

---
### 6. Challenges and Data Issues

**Data Discrepancy:** Mismatch between user interaction (df) and content metadata (df_content), with 714 unique articles in df and 1051 unique articles in `df_content**, leading to limited mapping for recommendations.

**Sparse User Article Vectors:** Sparse matrices for users with few interactions may yield unreliable cosine similarity scores, impacting recommendation quality.

**Handling Missing Values:** Missing values in content data disrupt the mapping between user interactions and articles, requiring strategies for imputation or alternative suggestions.

**Scalability and Performance:** Increased dataset sizes can slow down cosine similarity computations, necessitating efficient algorithms for responsiveness.

**Complexity of User Preferences:** User interests can be multifaceted; a content-based approach may not fully capture preferences, requiring hybrid methods for better recommendations.

---
### 7. Future Improvements
**User Feedback Incorporation**
Integrating user feedback enhances recommendation relevance by allowing the system to adapt to individual preferences over time.

**Hybrid Recommendation Approaches**
Combining content-based and collaborative filtering methods creates a more robust recommendation system that caters to diverse user interests.

**Scalability Enhancements**
Implementing efficient algorithms and leveraging cloud computing ensures the recommendation system can handle growing data volumes without sacrificing performance.

---
### 8. Conclusion
The implemented recommendation system effectively captures user preferences and identifies areas for improvement, such as integrating user feedback and enhancing scalability. Future work will focus on refining these strategies to create a more robust and adaptable recommendation framework.
