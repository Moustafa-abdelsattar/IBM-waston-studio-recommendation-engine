### 1. Overview

### 2.Data Exploration and Preprocessing

- **Data Analysis**: Conducted an exploratory analysis to understand user interactions with articles. This included visualizing the distribution of interactions and identifying patterns in user behavior.
  
- **Data Cleaning**: Removed duplicate articles to ensure data integrity, keeping only unique article entries.
  
- **Key Insights**:
  - Identified the most viewed article and calculated important statistics such as the number of unique users, articles, and interactions.

- **User Anonymization**: Mapped user emails to unique identifiers to maintain privacy, allowing for efficient data processing in later stages.
